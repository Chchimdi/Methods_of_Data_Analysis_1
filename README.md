# Statistics Class Assignments and Projects

## Overview
This repository contains all of my assignments from a comprehensive statistics class I completed, where I achieved an A grade. The class covered a wide range of statistical analysis techniques,
focusing on both theoretical understanding and practical application.

## Topics Covered
The course encompassed several key areas of statistical analysis, including:
- Graphical Methods: Understanding and applying graphical techniques to analyze and present data.
- Parametric Methods: Exploring parametric approaches for data analysis, focusing on assumptions and applications.
- Nonparametric Methods: Investigating nonparametric techniques for data analysis, especially useful when data doesn't meet parametric assumptions.
- Two-Sample Comparisons: Techniques for comparing two independent samples, using both parametric and nonparametric methods.
- One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): Methods for comparing more than two groups based on a single-factor (one-way) design.
- Two-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): Advanced analysis techniques for exploring the effects of two independent factors on a dependent variable.
- Simple Linear Regression: Basics of regression analysis, focusing on the relationship between two variables and predicting outcomes.

## Objectives Achieved
Through completing these assignments, I have gained:
- A deep understanding of various statistical methods and when to apply them.
- Hands-on experience with real data sets, applying statistical techniques to analyze and interpret data.
- Enhanced skills in statistical software and tools for data analysis.
- The ability to communicate statistical findings effectively through graphical representations and written analysis.

## Repository Structure
- `Graphical_Methods/`: Contains assignments related to data visualization and graphical analysis.
- `Parametric_vs_Nonparametric/`: Includes assignments that compare and contrast parametric and nonparametric approaches.
- `Two_Sample_Comparisons/`: Features work on comparing two independent samples using different statistical tests.
- `ANOVA/`: This directory is split into `One_Way/` and `Two_Way/`, containing assignments on one-way and two-way ANOVA, respectively.
- `Simple_Linear_Regression/`: Holds assignments focused on building and interpreting simple linear regression models.

## Tools Used
- Statistical analysis software (R, for data manipulation and visualization)
- Spreadsheet software for preliminary data analysis and visualization
